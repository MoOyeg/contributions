            "name": "CVE-2021-44228 - Remote Code Execution log4j vulnerability",
            "description": "A flaw was found in the Java logging library Apache Log4j in versions from 2.0.0 and before as well as version 2.14.1. This allows a remote attacker to execute code on the server if the system logs an attacker-controlled string value with the attacker's JNDI LDAP server lookup.",
            "rationale": "This issue only affects log4j versions between 2.0 and 2.14.1. In order to exploit this flaw you need:\n\nA remotely accessible endpoint with any protocol (HTTP, TCP, etc) that allows an attacker to send arbitrary data,\nA log statement in the endpoint that logs the attacker controlled data.\nDue to the existence of JMS Appender which can use JNDI in the log4j 1.x, it is possible that log4j version 1.x is also affected by this vulnerability. The impact is still under investigation.",
            "remediation": "There are two possible mitigations for this flaw in versions from 2.10 to 2.14.1:\n- Set the system property log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups to true, or\n- Remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath. For example:\n\nzip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class\n\nOtherwise, please upgrade to the fix version suggested. ",
